## eCommerce Admin Dashboard - Portfolio Project

As part of my portfolio, I developed an exciting eCommerce web application with a user-friendly and secure admin view. This admin dashboard empowers administrators to efficiently manage various aspects of the eCommerce platform, ensuring a seamless experience for users. Let me walk you through the key highlights:

##  Features:

### Centralized Control Center:
The admin dashboard serves as the central control center for authorized administrators. It provides an organized overview of all products available on the platform, enabling administrators to manage them effortlessly.

### Brand and Category Management:
The platform offers a diverse range of brands and product categories. With the brand and category management feature, administrators can easily view, organize, and update brand and category information. This ensures the products are well-structured for customers' convenience.

### User Registration and Login:
The admin view includes secure user registration and login functionalities. New users can sign up easily, and their passwords are encrypted for enhanced security. Returning users can log in with confidence, knowing their credentials are protected.
